Description
-----------
libcerializer is a C library which provides routines for data serialization, independent of the
underlying operating system architecture. Serialization is implemented for primitive data types,
as well as for more complex data types, with the help of a 'dynamic message' structure aimed
to hold the primitive data type contents.

Using libcerializer
--------------------
You can either copy directly the libcerializer sources to your project or compile it install it as
a share library. See the provided example for more details on how to use libcerializer.


Underlying OS architecture.
---------------------------
The serialization techniques do not use the underlying OS memory architecture. Instead they use
standard concepts or protocols (e.g. floating point values are (de)serialized using the IEE754
standard) to enable code portability. This might effect the (de)serialized accuracy, especially
for floating point values, since these standards introduce precision limits.

libcerializer has been tested on the following platforms.
- Solaris 2.6/2.8 (sparc)
- Linux x86_64 (intel)
- Windows 7 (32 bit/intel)
- Windows 10 (64 bit/intel)
